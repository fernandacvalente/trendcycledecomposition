# Trend-cycle decomposition in spatio-temporal point process
R code that perform inference procedures for a spatio-temporal point process adopting a dynamic representation of Log-Gaussian Cox process, using the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and estimate it through Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA). The idea is to modelling the intensity function through a decomposition of components of trend, seasonality, cycles, covariates and spatial effects, where the spatial effects change over time through an autoregressive functional structure.

The code reproduces the analyses in the paper
